  <span class="text-primary dark:text-white">Problem 1:</span> Labor hours are wasted on repetitive design tasks
</h2>

<br />
<br />

- People are better at being creative and machines are better at repetition.
- **40% of workers feel they waste 1/4 of their week on repetitive tasks.**
- Visual consistency is important and it is costly to adapt to change if you have thousands of products and images.

    <span class="text-primary dark:text-white">Problem 2:</span> 70.9% of people are hesitant to open the links they receive
  </h2>

  <br />
  <br />

  - Companies neglect how their links look when they are shared by people on social networks.
  - **The most important factor that determines people's trust and interest in links is the image and the URL.**
  - There is a sea of information and every day it is more difficult to capture people's attention.
